# Pet Grove — Simple Browser Pet-Garden Game

A lightweight single-page web game where you adopt and "grow" pets (like a garden but with pets). It's built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and stores progress in `localStorage`, so no backend is required.

Features
- Adopt different pets (represented by emojis).
- Feed and play with pets to raise XP and happiness.
- Pets level up and evolve through growth stages.
- Time-based decay (hunger / energy decrease over time).
- Persistent save using `localStorage`.
- Small, easily-extendable codebase — ideal as a starter for adding animations, images, multiplayer, or server-side saving.

How to run
1. Clone or copy files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. Play! Progress is saved automatically.

Ideas for next steps
- Replace emoji sprites with artwork.
- Add multiple pets per player with a "garden".
- Add shop for food/toys/cosmetics.
- Add achievements, leaderboards (requires backend).
- Add animations and sound effects.
